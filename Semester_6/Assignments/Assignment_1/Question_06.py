'''

Using private attributes in a class improves data security and prevents accidental modifications in the following ways:

-> Data Security: Private attributes ensure that critical data, like a bank account balance, is not directly accessible or modifiable from outside the class. This reduces the risk of unauthorized changes.

-> Controlled Access: Access to private attributes is restricted to specific methods, which allows the class to enforce rules (e.g., ensuring the balance doesnâ€™t go negative).

-> Prevents Accidental Changes: Direct manipulation of private data is prevented, reducing the risk of errors or bugs due to invalid values being set.

-> Encapsulation: Private attributes are part of the principle of encapsulation, which hides the internal details of the class and exposes only necessary functionality, improving code maintainability.

-> Data Integrity: By controlling how data is accessed and modified, private attributes help ensure the integrity and consistency of the object's state.
