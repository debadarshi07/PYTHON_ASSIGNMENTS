In Python, classes are a key feature of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), allowing for the creation of objects that bundle data (attributes) and methods (functions). They contribute to OOP in the following ways:

-> Encapsulation: Groups related data and methods, hiding internal details while providing controlled access.

-> Abstraction: Simplifies complex systems by exposing only relevant functionalities to the user.

-> Inheritance: Enables reuse by allowing a new class to inherit attributes and methods from an existing one.

-> Polymorphism: Allows different classes to have methods with the same name but different implementations.

-> Modularity: Promotes reusable, maintainable code by organizing functionality into separate classes.

Thus, classes help in structuring code, enhancing readability, and fostering reusability in software development.
