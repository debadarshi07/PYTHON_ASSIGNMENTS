    "Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging is the process of assigning a part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to each word in a sentence based on its definition and context. It helps in understanding the grammatical structure of a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance of POS Tagging:\n",
    "    (1). Sentence Structure Understanding: Helps analyze the syntax and structure of sentences.\n",
    "    (2). Machine Translation: Assists in accurately translating sentences between languages by recognizing word roles.\n",
    "    (3). Disambiguation: Resolves word ambiguity by understanding context (e.g., \"bank\" as a financial institution or a riverbank).\n",
    "    (4). Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifies proper nouns, such as names of people, organizations, or places.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "    In the sentence \"She plays tennis\":\n",

    "POS tagging helps to identify the roles of each word, aiding in accurate language processing.\n",
